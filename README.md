README


1.we have added some more predicates and terms to the epilog knowledge base. So please replace the orgin version of el-lexicon.lisp file by the el-lexicon.lisp is our package before you try to use our system.


2.You should first load our “ui” file to start the whole system by type (load “FP_CSC444/ui”) from epi2 file path.


3.After your successfully load our ui file, you can call the “start” function by type (start) to start our system. Then, you just need to follow the directions given by the program. Please note that all the input should be in the form of a list. For example, when input the user’s name, type (kevin) but not kevin. And when input item (tennis), instead of tennis or “tennis”.
